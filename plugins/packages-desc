 "bwm-ng":"Bandwidth Monitor NG is a small and simple curses-based bandwidth monitor for Linux or other systems with \/proc\/net\/dev or net-tools netstat. You can choose whether to show all interfaces or only those interfaces that are up.",
 "cpio":"This is GNU cpio, a program to manage archives of files. This package also includes mt, a tape drive control program. cpio copies files into or out of a cpio or tar archive, which is a file that contains other files plus information about them, such as their pathname, owner, timestamps, and access permissions.

 "git":"Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.  git  can mean anything, depending on your mood. Git was originally written by Linus Torvalds and is currently maintained by Junio C. Hamano.",
 "iftop":"iftop does for network usage what top(1) does for CPU usage. It listens to network traffic on a named interface and displays a table of current bandwidth usage by pairs of hosts. Handy for answering the question  why is our link so slow?",
 "inotify-tools":"inotify-tools is a set of command-line programs for Linux providing a simple interface to inotify. These programs can be used to monitor and act upon filesystem events. For more information see the inotifywait and inotifywatch man pages.",
 "iotop":"iotop is a Python program with a top-like UI used to show of behalf of which process is the I\/O going on.",
 "iperf":"iperf is a tool for active measurements of the maximum achievable bandwidth on IP networks. It supports tuning of various parameters related to timing, protocols, and buffers. For each test it reports the bandwidth, loss, and other parameters. Iperf3 is a redesign of an original version developed at NLANR\/DAST",
 "jhead":"jhead displays and manipulates data contained in the Exif header of JPEG images from digital cameras. For many tasks, jhead remains the simplest and most effective tool for the job, especially if used for automated or scripted tasks.",
 "kbd":"Load and save keyboard mappings. Needed if you are not using the US keyboard map. This package also contains utilities to change your console fonts - if you install it you ll get a menu later on that lets you select from many different fonts. If you like one, you can make it your default font. A new default font can be chosen at any time by typing  setconsolefont.",
 "lftp":"lftp is a program that allows sophisticated ftp and http connections to other hosts. lftp can handle many file access methods including ftp, ftps, http, https, hftp, fish and file. Every operation in lftp is reliable, that is any non-fatal error is ignored and the operation is retried. lftp has shell-like command syntax. lftp has a built in mirror feature which can download or upload a whole directory tree. To learn about many more features of lftp, see  man lftp.",
 "lshw":"lshw (Hardware Lister) is a small tool to provide detailed information on the hardware configuration of the machine. It can report exact memory configuration, firmware version, mainboard configuration, CPU version and speed, cache configuration, bus speed, etc. on DMI-capable x86 or EFI (IA-64) systems and on some PowerPC machines.",
 "neon":"neon is an HTTP and WebDAV client library, with a C language API. Bindings for other languages may also be available, see the web site for more details:  The neon library is used by projects such as subversion.",
 "p7zip":"7-Zip is a well-known file compression utility for windows. p7zip is a ported version for linux with nearly the same capabilities.",
 "perl":"Larry Wall s  Practical Extraction and Report Language . Perl is a language optimized for scanning arbitrary text files, extracting information from those text files, and printing reports based on that information. It s also a good language for many system management tasks. The language is intended to be practical (easy to use, efficient, complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal).",
 "python":"Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language that combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. Python s basic power can be extended with your own modules written in C or C++. Python is also adaptable as an extension language for existing applications.",
 "readline":"The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in. Both Emacs and vi editing modes are available. The Readline library includes additional functions to maintain a list of previously entered command lines, to recall and perhaps edit those lines, and perform csh-like history expansion on previous commands.",
 "screen":"Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal between several processes (typically interactive shells). Each virtual terminal provides the functions of a DEC VT100 terminal and several control functions from the ISO 6492 (ECMA 48, ANSI X3.64) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g. insert\/delete line and support for multiple character sets). There is a scrollback history buffer for each virtual terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows moving text regions between windows.",
 "sshfs-fuse":"This is a filesystem client based on the SSH File Transfer Protocol. Since most SSH servers already support this protocol it is very easy to set up: i.e. on the server side there s nothing to do. On the client side mounting the filesystem is as easy as logging into the server with ssh.",
 "strace":"Strace allows you to trace the execution of a command. It runs the specified command until it exits, intercepting signals and system calls and dumping the information to the standard error. System administrators, diagnosticians and trouble-shooters will find it invaluable for solving problems with programs for which the source is not readily available since they do not need to be recompiled in order to trace them.",
 "subversion":"Subversion is a version control system which allows you to keep old versions of files and directories (usually source code), and keep a log of who, when, and why changes occurred, similar to other such systems like CVS, RCS or SCCS. Subversion keeps all the information to permit extracting previous versions of those files at any time. For more information about the Subversion project.",
 "unrar":"The UnRAR utility is a freeware program, distributed with source code and developed for extracting, testing and viewing the contents of archives created with the RAR archiver version 1.50 and above. The UnRAR library is a minor part of the RAR archiver and contains the RAR uncompression algorithm. UnRAR requires very small volume of memory to operate. The UnRAR library can also be used by other programs to extract RAR archives.",
 "utempter":"The utempter package provides a utility and shared library that allows terminal applications such as xterm and screen to update \/var\/run\/utmp and \/var\/log\/wtmp without requiring root privileges.",
 "vim":"Vim is an almost compatible version of the UNIX editor vi. Many new features have been added: multi level undo, command line history, filename completion, block operations, and more. Vim s development is led by Bram Moolenaar. This package also contains the Exuberant Ctags program written by Darren Hiebert."
