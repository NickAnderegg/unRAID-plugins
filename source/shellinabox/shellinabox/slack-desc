# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

shellinabox:
shellinabox: Shell In A Box implements a web server that exports arbitrary command
shellinabox: line tools to a web based terminal emulator. This emulator is
shellinabox: accessible to any JavaScript and CSS enabled web browser and does not
shellinabox: require any additional browser plugins. Most typically, login shells 
shellinabox: would be exported this way. All client-server communications are
shellinabox: encrypted, if SSL/TLS certificates have been installed.
